## Abstract

This pilot study investigates the feasibility of fine-tuning a large pre-trained language model, specifically DistilBERT, to classify levels of emotional and social Intelligence (EI and SI) using a modified constructed-response Situational Judgment Test (SJT). The main aim of this study was to evaluate the models ability to differentiate between low and high levels of these constructs accurately, based on open responses to targeted scenarios related to specific EI and SI competencies. Results indicate the fine-tuned DistilBERT model was successful in distinguishing between low and high levels, with the overall classifier exhibiting robust performance metrics. However, sub-competency classifiers exhibited varying degrees of performance, with the SI classifiers displaying strong performance, and the EI classifier showing moderate performance. These findings contribute to the growing research on using transformer models for psychological assessment and suggest the need for further exploration of model interpretability, alternative methods for assessing EI and SI competencies, and the utility of larger foundational models and different model architectures.
