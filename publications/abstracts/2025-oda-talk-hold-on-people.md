## Description

If you manage people in a dental practice, this interactive discussion is for you. I've had the opportunity to watch my wife's dental practice grow and develop since 2011. We will bring real-world examples of the ups and downs of building a dental practice, hiring an office manager and building relationships with team members. We will draw upon some of the latest research on personal and emotional intelligence from Trent University's Emotion and Health Research Lab, and how this can help you nurture your relationships with the people around you. We will leave you with three resources from the lab: (1) an ongoing study on relationship satisfaction across the lifespan, (2) the Multidimensional Inventory for Personal Intelligence and (3) a research tool that can help you visualize your practice production over time.

## Learning Objectives

- Does my office culture feel right? (feeling attachment relationships at work)
- Should I put together a performance improvement plan? (predicting if a relationship will improve ... enough)
- What does "success" look like? (using the wisdom of Occam's razor)
